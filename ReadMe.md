## Description  
  Creates Telnet Menus from the XML files downloaded from Telnet BBS List into Gamesrv compatible menus to enable users to telnet directly to other BBS's on the menu list. Currently this program only parses the dialdirectory.xml file from the ibbsxxxxxx.zip files. Initianlly this program was going to parse the CSV file from the same zip file but as their zip contents/requirements change we are trying to as well.
